## About Me
I want to build systems that matter. My current focus is Python, Go, Java, TypeScript SWE positions - the kind where architecture decisions compound over time and poor choices create exponential technical debt.

### My Philosophy
My background as a founder has taught me that **software without a defensible moat is just expensive maintenance.**
* **Context is King:** Technology without context is waste. I've learned that the best solution isn't always the most sophisticated—it’s the one that solves the right problem for the right user.
* **Impact over Elegance:** Understanding business context changes how you write code. You stop optimizing for elegance and start optimizing for impact.
* **Ask "Why" before "How":** I build systems that create actual leverage, not just technical complexity.

I'm looking for teams that understand this—where engineering decisions connect to real outcomes, and where building the **right thing** matters more than building things right.
