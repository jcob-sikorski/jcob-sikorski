# 💫 About Me:
About Me<br>I'm Jacob. I want to build systems that matter.<br><br>Current focus: Java Spring Boot positions. I want to work on complex enterprise systems—the kind where architecture decisions compound over time and poor choices create exponential technical debt. It's exciting!<br><br>What I've learned outside code:<br>I founded a small consultancy integrating AI into local businesses. The pattern became clear: technology without context is waste. The best solution isn't the most sophisticated - it's the one that solves the right problem for the right user.<br><br>I launched a deepfake platform right when it emerged in 2023. I built a Shopify app that failed. Both taught me the same lesson: without a defensible moat, you're going to fail. Software without competitive advantage is just expensive maintenance.<br><br>Why this matters for engineering:<br>Understanding business context changes how you write code. You stop optimizing for elegance and start optimizing for impact. You ask "why" before "how." You build systems that create actual leverage, not just technical complexity.<br><br>I'm looking for teams that understand this—where engineering decisions connect to real outcomes, and where building the right thing matters more than building things right.
